# RNN
Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are the state of the art algorithm for sequential data and are used by Apple's Siri and and Google's voice search. It is the first algorithm that remembers its input, due to an internal memory, which makes it perfectly suited for machine learning problems that involve sequential data. 
INTRODUCTION
RNN’s can remember important things about the input they received, which allows them to be very precise in predicting what’s coming next. This is why they're the preferred algorithm for sequential data like time series, speech, text, financial data, audio, video, weather and much more. Recurrent neural networks can form a much deeper understanding of a sequence and its context compared to other algorithms.
